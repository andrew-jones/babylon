== Platform Architecture Principles

=== Cloud-Native Design
Babylon follows cloud-native principles with microservices architecture, containerized components, and declarative configuration management. This ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

=== GitOps and Infrastructure as Code
All configuration and infrastructure definitions are managed through Git repositories, enabling version control, peer review, and automated deployment processes.

=== Event-Driven Architecture
Components communicate through Kubernetes events and custom resource status updates, enabling loose coupling and scalable operations.

=== Security by Design
Role-based access control, secrets management, network policies, and audit logging are built into the platform architecture from the ground up.
